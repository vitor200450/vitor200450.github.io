## My process

### Built with

-   Basic HTML5
-   Basic CSS with some flexbox uses

### What I learned

This project was also a good shot to review some basic flexbox layout topics, and I also used some different variations for size units, like the percentage one! Also did some first spot on using negative margin to change some positioning, and overall that's it!

Overall, I like how I am going far by doing this simple challenges, and I wanna keep it up with the next ones! Let's see how much I can improve...
