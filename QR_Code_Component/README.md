## My process

### Built with

-   Basic HTML5
-   Basic CSS with a little bit use of FlexBox

### What I learned

This project was an actual great starting point to think about simple positioning aspects, like how the elements should be placed (with the flex-direction prop) and how the margin/padding properties are working in continuity with the other elements.

Since it's a simple project, there's nothing that much interesting to show off. But I can say, that's a great start!
